Open the image.txt file
"nano videoPath.txt"
Clear
Enter your image file name with path
"home/kali/Desktop/test.jpg"
Save

If it isn't working goto "image.txt" and Enter filepath correctly.
(This tool reads firstline only! So delete all nextlines)

then run the python file
"python3 main.py"

ENJOY!!
